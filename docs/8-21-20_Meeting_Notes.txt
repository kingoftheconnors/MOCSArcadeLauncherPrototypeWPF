Themes: Intutive UI, Robust Execution, and Virtual (can be generically run separate from arcade) are guiding principles for this project's design
Initiatives: Launcher and API are separate projects



**The Launcher Project**:
Connor: Autohotkey
  Regularly checks for a MocsArcade_* process to focus on. If no game is open, focus on the launcher. If there is no launcher, open a new launcher
  If two games are open, the game that was opened first (which the autohotkey program has set as the "active game") will be kept open and the other will be closed
  The first time a game is sensed to be open, read the config file in the game folder to change the keybinds for the player to fit the game
  The autohotkey will have a special "kill all" button that closes all games and reopens the launcher

Andrew: Launcher
  Runs a UI for the player to select a game. There are two buttons: SELECT, and INFO
  The launcher will open a game as a separate process and then close itself
  The launcher may have an "arcade mode" if necessary
  The launcher will have a keybind-config file similar to regular games
  The stylish UI will be the hardest thing to make
